      The difference between this impl. and the previous is that, rather
      than creating and retaining a matrix of size s.length() + 1 by t.length() + 1,
      we maintain two single-dimensional arrays of length s.length() + 1.  The first, d,
      is the 'current working' distance array that maintains the newest distance cost
      counts as we iterate through the characters of String s.  Each time we increment
      the index of String t we are comparing, d is copied to p, the second int[].  Doing so
      allows us to retain the previous cost counts as required by the algorithm (taking
      the minimum of the cost count to the left, up one, and diagonally up and to the left
      of the current cost count being calculated).  (Note that the arrays aren't really
      copied anymore, just switched...this is clearly much better than cloning an array
      or doing a System.arraycopy() each time  through the outer loop.)

      Effectively, the difference between the two implementations is this one does not
      cause an out of memory condition when calculating the LD over two very large strings.
